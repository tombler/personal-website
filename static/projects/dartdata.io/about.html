                <p>
                  The story of Dart really starts with CEO and Founder Chris McMurtry. As an indie rock musician, Chris had successfully distributed 22 albums through normal distribution channels. But McMurtry also happens to compose classical music. The first time he tried to distribute one of his classical works, he pretty much hit a brick wall. Digging deeper, he learned that compared to most music genres, metadata for classical music was so hopelessly complex that nobody was willing to take it on. 
<br><br>
A member of Apple’s Information Systems and Technology team, McMurtry was certain that a solution was technically within reach. So he created Dart Music as a way to fill this data gap. The Nashville-based company was built specifically as an automated distribution platform capable of handling every level of complex music metadata. This meant creating algorithms that went far beyond industry norms. It meant designing a system capable of collecting, cleaning and perfecting metadata like never before.
<br><br>
Dart’s Perfect Metadata solution was an immediate success, opening the door to partnerships with companies like Apple, Google, Amazon and Spotify. Classical artists worldwide were finally getting recognized – and paid – for their work. Listeners had far wider choices than ever before. Music was easier to find and share. 
<br><br>
But it turned out classical music wasn’t the only field where Perfect Metadata could be a true game changer. Dart’s client partners began talking about other musical genres. About the benefits for industries like book publishing. Even movies. 
<br><br>
It seems that by solving one problem, McMurtry’s team created technology capable of solving many others: better discoverability, more accurate payouts and major workflow efficiencies, to name a few.
<br><br>
And the rest, as they say, is history.

                  <strong>Chris McMurtry - Founder/CEO</strong>
<br><br>
Chris is a rock guitarist, technologist and classically trained composer. He spent several years at Apple, where he worked as a member of the Information Systems and Technology team before departing to found an independent classical music label. When he learned firsthand how difficult and expensive it was to release music within the classical genre, he became a man with a mission. Dart is the result.
